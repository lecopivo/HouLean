  This Houdini plugin allows you to use Lean 4 as a scripting language/replacement of VEX. This plugin is highly experimental!

* Installation instructions

  To build =HouLean= run these commands:
#+begin_src
  lake script run compileCpp /opt/hfs19.0
  lake build
  labe script run install ~/houdini19.0
#+end_src
  If necessary, replace =/opt/hfs19.0= with your Houdini install path and =~/houdini19.0= with Houdini preference directory.

  Before running Houdini you need to make sure =libHouLean.so= is found, do this by setting up =LD_LIBRARY_PATH= as follows. (Let me know if you have an idea how get rid of this step)
#+begin_src
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:~/houdini19.0/dso
  houdini
#+end_src

If you open up scene from =houdini/hip/example.hip= you should see the above picture.
