* Installation instructions

  To build =HouLean= run this command these commands. Replace =/opt/hfs19.0= with your Houdini install path and =~/houdini19.0= with Houdini preference directory.
#+begin_src
  export HFS=/opt/hfs19.0
  lake script run build ~/houdini19.0
#+end_src

  Before running Houdini you need to make sure =libHouLean.so= is found, do this by setting up =LD_LIBRARY_PATH= as follows. (Let me know if you have an idea how get rid of this step)
#+begin_src
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:~/houdini19.0/dso
  houdini
#+end_src

If you open up scene from =houdini/hip/dev.hip= you should see the above picture.
